# Lab 4B: Working with Datasets

Datasets provide a way to encapsulate data for experiments and training. You can use tabular and file datasets to define versioned sources of data that can easily be consumed in experiments.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Work with Datasets

In this task, you'll use code in a notebook to work with tabular and file datasets.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance.
2. When the compute instance is running, refresh the Azure Machine Learning studio web page in your browser to ensure your authenticated session has not expired. Then click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **Users/DP100** folder, open the **04B - Working with Datasets.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
4. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
5. If you're finished working with Azure Machine Learning for the day, in Azure Machine Learning studio, on the **Compute** page, on the **Compute Instances** tab, select your compute instance and click **Stop** to shut it down. Otherwise, leave it running for the next lab.
