# Lab 8A: Tuning Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are variables that affect how a model is trained, but which can't be derived from the training data. Choosing the optimal hyperparameter values for model training can be difficult, and usually involved a great deal of trial and error.

In this lab, you'll use Azure Machine Learning to tune hyperparameters by performing multiple training runs in parallel.

## Before You Start

Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed [Lab 1A](Lab01A.md) and [Lab 1B](Lab01B.md), which include tasks to create the Azure Machine Learning workspace and other resources used in this lab.

## Task 1: Tune Hyperparameters

In this task, you'll run an experiment to optimize hyperparameters for model training.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), view the **Compute** page for your workspace; and on the **Compute Instances** tab, start your compute instance.
2. When the compute instance is running, refresh the Azure Machine Learning studio web page in your browser to ensure your authenticated session has not expired. Then click the **Jupyter** link to open the Jupyter home page in a new browser tab.
3. In the Jupyter home page, in the **Users/DP100** folder, open the **08A - Tuning Hyperparameters.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
4. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
5. If you're finished working with Azure Machine Learning for the day, in Azure Machine Learning studio, on the **Compute** page, on the **Compute Instances** tab, select your compute instance and click **Stop** to shut it down. Otherwise, leave it running for the next lab.
