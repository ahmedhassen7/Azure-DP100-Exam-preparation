# Lab 1B: Working with Azure Machine Learning Tools

In this lab, you will explore various tools for working with an Azure Machine Learning workspace.

## Before You Start

Before starting this lab, you must have created an Azure Machine Learning workspace by following the instructions in the [previous lab](Lab01A.md).

## Task 1: Use the Azure ML SDK in a Compute Instance

You can perform most asset management tasks to set up your environment in the *Studio* interface, but it's also important to be able to script configuration tasks to make them easier to repeat and automate.

1. In [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com), on the **Compute** page for your workspace, view the **Compute Instances** tab, and if necessary, click **Refresh** periodically until the compute instance you created in the previous lab has started.
2. Refresh the Azure Machine Learning studio web page in your browser to ensure your authenticated session has not expired. Then click your compute instance's **Jupyter** link  to open Jupyter Notebooks in a new tab. If prompted, sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.
3. In the notebook environment, create a new **Terminal**. This will open a new tab with a command shell.
4. The Azure Machine Learning SDK is already installed in the compute instance image, but it's worth ensuring you have the latest version, with the optional packages you'll need in this course; so enter the following command to update the SDK packages:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade azureml-sdk[notebooks,automl,explain]
    ```

    You may see some warnings as the package dependencies are installed. You can ignore these.

    > **More Information**: For more details about installing the Azure ML SDK and its optional components, see the [Azure ML SDK Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py).

5. Next, run the following commands to change the current directory to the **Users** directory, and retrieve the notebooks you will use in the labs for this course:

    ```bash
    cd Users
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP100
    ```

6. After the command has completed, close the terminal tab and view the home page in your Jupyter notebook file explorer. Then open the **Users** folder - it should contain an **DP100** folder, containing the files you will use in the rest of this lab.
7. In the **Users/DP100** folder, open the **01B - Intro to the Azure ML SDK.ipynb** notebook. Then read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.
8. When you have finished running the code in the notebook, on the **File** menu, click **Close and Halt** to close it and shut down its Python kernel. Then close all Jupyter browser tabs.
9. If you're finished working with Azure Machine Learning for the day, in Azure Machine Learning studio, on the **Compute** page, select your compute instance and click **Stop** to shut it down. Otherwise, leave it running for the next lab.
